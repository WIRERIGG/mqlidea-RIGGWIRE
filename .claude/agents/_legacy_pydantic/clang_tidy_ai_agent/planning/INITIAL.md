- **Zero-Warnings System**: Maintain compatibility with zero-warnings build system
- **Git Hook Integration**: Work with existing prevention system

### Interface Modes
1. **Interactive CLI**: Conversational interface for code review and fixes
2. **Automated Mode**: Enhanced version of existing automated fixing
3. **Batch Analysis**: Process multiple files with AI insights
4. **Learning Mode**: Capture user preferences and improve recommendations

## External Dependencies

### Required APIs
- **LLM Provider API**: OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, or equivalent for conversational analysis
- **Code Analysis**: Integration with existing clang-tidy binary
- **File System**: Read/write access to project files and logs

### Environment Variables
```
LLM_PROVIDER=openai|anthropic|gemini|ollama
LLM_API_KEY=<api_key>
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4|claude-3-sonnet|gemini-pro
LLM_BASE_URL=<optional_custom_endpoint>
CLANG_TIDY_AI_DB_PATH=./clang_tidy_ai.db
CLANG_TIDY_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Conversational Interface**: Users can discuss code quality issues in natural language
- [ ] **Fix Explanation**: Every recommended fix includes clear, educational explanation
- [ ] **Strategy Selection**: AI chooses optimal fix approaches based on code context
- [ ] **Learning System**: Improves recommendations based on user feedback
- [ ] **Integration**: Seamlessly works with existing clang-tidy infrastructure

### Quality Gates  
- [ ] **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing automated scripts continue to work unchanged
- [ ] **Performance**: Interactive responses within 2-3 seconds for typical queries
- [ ] **Accuracy**: Fix recommendations should be contextually appropriate >90% of the time
- [ ] **Educational Value**: Explanations help developers learn and improve code quality understanding

### Technical Validation
- [ ] **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with at least 3 different LLM providers
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable
- [ ] **Security**: Proper handling of API keys and sensitive code data
- [ ] **Compatibility**: Works with existing CLion integration and build system

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Response Time**: <3 seconds for interactive queries
- **Throughput**: Handle analysis of 100+ files in batch mode
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB additional overhead over base clang-tidy system

### Security
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage and handling of LLM provider keys
- **Code Privacy**: Option to run with local models (Ollama) for sensitive projects
- **Audit Trail**: Log all AI-assisted fixes for review and compliance

### Usability
- **Learning Curve**: Minimal - enhance existing workflow rather than replace
- **Documentation**: Clear usage examples and integration guides
- **Fallback**: Always provide option to use traditional clang-tidy without AI
