# Multi-Agent Debugging System - Initial Requirements

## Agent Classification

**Type**: Multi-Agent Orchestrator System
**Category**: C++ Code Analysis & Debugging
**Complexity**: MVP (Minimal Viable Product)
**Framework**: PydanticAI-based multi-agent coordination

## Overview

A sophisticated multi-agent system that orchestrates C++ debugging and analysis tools through intelligent agent coordination. The system provides comprehensive code analysis by running multiple debugging tools in parallel and correlating their findings.

## Core Features (MVP Scope)

### 1. Multi-Agent Tool Orchestration
- **Agent Coordinator**: Central orchestrator managing tool-specific agents
- **Tool Agents**: Specialized agents for each debugging tool (gdb, strace, ltrace, perf, cppcheck, clang-tidy, valgrind)
- **Result Aggregator**: Agent that correlates and merges findings from multiple tools

### 2. Parallel Analysis Execution
- **Static Analysis Mode**: Run cppcheck, clang-tidy in parallel
- **Dynamic Analysis Mode**: Execute gdb, strace, ltrace, perf, valgrind concurrently
- **Comprehensive Mode**: Combine both static and dynamic analysis with intelligent scheduling

### 3. Intelligent Finding Correlation
- **Cross-tool Correlation**: Identify related issues across different tool outputs
- **Priority Ranking**: Rank findings by severity and confidence level
- **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate findings across tools

## Functional Requirements

### F1: Agent-Based Tool Management
- Each debugging tool runs through a dedicated PydanticAI agent
- Agents communicate through structured message passing
- Central coordinator manages agent lifecycle and task distribution
- Support for tool-specific configuration and parameters

### F2: Parallel Execution Framework
- Execute multiple tools simultaneously based on analysis mode
- Handle tool dependencies and execution order
- Manage resource allocation and conflict resolution
- Timeout and error handling for individual tool agents

### F3: Structured Output Generation
- **JSON Output**: Machine-readable structured results with standardized schema
- **Human-Readable Output**: Formatted reports with summaries and recommendations
- **Correlation Metadata**: Track which agents contributed to each finding
- **Analysis Statistics**: Execution time, success rates, coverage metrics

## Technical Requirements

### T1: PydanticAI Integration
- Use PydanticAI for agent definition and coordination
- Implement structured communication protocols between agents
- Leverage Pydantic models for type-safe data exchange
- Support for agent state management and persistence

### T2: Tool Integration Architecture
- Wrapper agents for each debugging tool with standardized interfaces
- Command execution with proper error handling and logging
- Output parsing and normalization for each tool
- Resource management and cleanup

### T3: Output Format Specification

## Success Criteria

### S1: Multi-Agent Coordination
- [ ] Successfully orchestrate 7 different debugging tool agents
- [ ] Maintain structured communication between all agents
- [ ] Handle agent failures gracefully without system crash
- [ ] Complete analysis within reasonable time bounds (<5 minutes for medium projects)

### S2: Analysis Quality
- [ ] Generate comprehensive findings from multiple tools
- [ ] Achieve >80% accuracy in cross-tool correlation
- [ ] Reduce duplicate findings by >90% through intelligent deduplication
- [ ] Provide actionable recommendations for >75% of findings

### S3: Output Format Compliance
- [ ] Generate valid JSON output matching specified schema
- [ ] Produce readable human-format reports
- [ ] Include execution metadata and statistics
- [ ] Support both file and stdout output options

## Implementation Assumptions

### A1: Environment
- Target C++ projects are buildable and executable
- Standard Unix debugging tools are available in system PATH
- Sufficient disk space for temporary analysis files
- Network access not required (standalone operation)

### A2: Scope Limitations
- Focus on single C++ project analysis (not multi-project)
- Support common C++ build systems (Make, CMake)
- Target Linux/Unix environments primarily
- Handle projects up to medium complexity (10K-100K LOC)

### A3: User Interface
- Command-line interface with configuration options
- Programmatic API for integration with other tools
- File-based configuration for complex analysis scenarios
- No GUI required for MVP

## Risk Mitigation

### R1: Tool Dependency Management
- **Risk**: External debugging tools not available or incompatible versions
- **Mitigation**: Tool detection and version validation, graceful degradation

### R2: Resource Management
- **Risk**: Parallel tool execution consuming excessive system resources
- **Mitigation**: Resource limits, intelligent scheduling, configurable parallelism

### R3: Agent Communication Failures
- **Risk**: PydanticAI agent communication breakdowns
- **Mitigation**: Robust error handling, agent health monitoring, fallback modes
